- What is BogoSort?
- Where you randomise all the items in the array until they are sorted
- To do this:
- We shuffle - meaning we take the input array of elements and randomly shuffle them
- We then check - meaning we check if the shuffled array is now all sorted
- We then repeat/iterate this process until it is sorted
- It has O(n!) -> O(infinite) time order
